# Saved Posts

## Project Overview
The **Saved Posts** project is a web application designed to display a user's saved posts in a clean and user-friendly interface. It utilizes modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with Tailwind CSS for styling. The application includes features for displaying posts, managing error states, and viewing post details in a modal.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser:

## Usage
Once the application is running, you'll see a layout where saved posts (if any) are displayed. If there are errors loading posts, users will see an error message indicating the issue. Clicking on a post opens a modal displaying more information and visuals related to the post.

## Features
- Display of saved posts in a responsive grid layout.
- Error handling mechanism to inform users of loading issues.
- Modal popup to view post details, including images and captions.
- Responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes.

## Dependencies

- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons.

You can find the external scripts included in the `index.html` file under the `<head>` section.
